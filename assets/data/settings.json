Who can afford to live here?\n\nThe Center for Urban Pedagogy (CUP) created this site so you can look at income demographics and rents in neighborhoods all over New York City.\n\nWhen you click on a neighborhood, you’ll see the number of families in each of five income categories, shown across the bottom of the page. Click on “Who can afford to live here?” and you’ll be able to slide rent markers around, showing you who can and can’t afford to live here, based on those rents.\n\nThe income categories come from the federal government, and are the categories that people use to talk about affordable housing. (Incomes are shown for families of four, that means a family with four related people living together.)\n\nFor more information about affordable housing, or to learn about CUP’s Affordable Housing Toolkit, visit our <a href='http://welcometocup.org/Projects/EnvisioningDevelopment/WhatIsAffordableHousing' target='_blank'>website</a>.",
