What's 'affordable'?
 The government says that housing is 'affordable' if you spend 30%25 or less of your income to live there.

The bottom number on this color bar translates your annual income into 'affordable' monthly rent. Thirty percent of $20,000 per year, for instance, is $500 per month. 

Use the rent sliders to estimate how much it costs to rent a one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartment in that neighborhood.&amp;whatNowText=To learn more about how affordable housing works in your neighborhood,
order or download the book 'What Is Affordable Housing?' or order the 'What Is Affordable Housing?' workshop kit.

These categories are expressed as percentages of the 'median family income.' The MFI for a family of four in Greater New York (which includes the City and some of its suburbs) is $76,800 per year."></div>
